"""
Original, basic shoaling model

Model of shoaling behavior based on the Boids model by Craig Reynolds in 1986,
using the basic code provided in the Flocker example of the Mesa framework for
agent-based modelling in Python. This model is based on 3 parameters that each
agent follows:
    1. Attraction to (coherence with) other agents,
    2. Avoidance of other agents,
    3. Alignment with other agents.

Data is collected on the median absolute deviation of velocity and the nearest
neighbor distance, calculated using a k-d tree, as measures of cohesion.

The model is based on a bounded, 3D area. Later additions will include 
obstacles, environmental gradients, and agents with goal-, food-, or 
safety-seeking behaviour.

This script also includes the code for visualizing the model using an HTML5
object. The parameters for the visualization rely on a JavaScript canvas.
